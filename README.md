# aws-api-client

A JavaScript module to consume AWS API Gateway endpoints using AWS SDK. This is the same code generated by AWS, but packaged to be used as ES6 modules compatible with bundlers like Webpack.

## Install

`npm install --save aws-api-client`

## Background
When we generate AWS API Gateway SDKs for JavaScript, they are built expecting you to import all the JavaScript files inside the `lib` folder, declaring everything as global variables.
This might be useful for simple applications, but for others using bundlers like Webpack, you need to be able to import modules instead.
This NPM module allows you to get rid of that `lib` folder by importing those JS functions instead.

## Use

You can download a JavaScript SDK for your code like mentioned here: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/how-to-generate-sdk.html

Then, do the following replacements in the apigClient.js file generated by AWS:

### Include the module
Import the module with the following line of code

``
	import {APIGatewayClient, Utils, uritemplate} from 'aws-api-client'
``

### APIGatewayClient

Replace instances of `apiGateway.core.apiGatewayClientFactory.newClient` from this:

`var apiGatewayClient = apiGateway.core.apiGatewayClientFactory.newClient(simpleHttpClientConfig, sigV4ClientConfig);`

to this:

`var apiGatewayClient = new APIGatewayClient(simpleHttpClientConfig, sigV4ClientConfig);`

### Utils
Replace instances of `apiGateway.core.utils` for `var utils = new Utils()`:

Example:

`apiGateway.core.utils.assertParametersDefined(params, [], ['body']);`

``
	var utils = new Utils();
	utils.assertParametersDefined(params, [], ['body']);
``

### uritemplate

The variable uritemplate is exported as a function, so you shouldn't need to change anything.
